# Major Design Presentations

Every major design decision is required to have an accompanying presentation for the PR. The presentation should include:
* Background on the task/purpose
* Major technologies/packages/libraries used
* Research/reference resources
* A clear explanation of why that design was chosen
* Any future development to be done on the task
